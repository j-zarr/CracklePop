####Task: 
Write a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive). If the number is divisible by 3, print Crackle instead of the number. If it's divisible by 5, print Pop. If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print CracklePop.

####Solution: 
There are two files that each provide a solution, one using a loop (loop.js) and the other using recursion (recursion.js). 


To run the recursive solution, in the terminal type: **node recursive**


To run the for loop solution, in the terminal type: **node loop**  


To be able to run tests, you will need to install the node modules, in the terminal type:
**npm i**


To run tests, in the terminal type:
**npm test**
